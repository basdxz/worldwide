# Worldwide

</h1>

A graphical user interface for WorldEdit. Worldwide is designed
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Due to changes in the internal API, this implementation builds
against [FalsePattern's fork of WorldEdit](https://github.com/FalsePattern/WorldEdit).
Which is required both server and client side for this mod to work correctly.

## Fork Info

This is a fork based
on [this commit](https://github.com/Mumfrey/WorldEditCUI/commit/c53c6eaef37ffdc69fe700be75db96b2be15668b)
of [Mumfrey's](https://github.com/Mumfrey) WorldEdit CUI.

Noteworthy changes:

- Ported from LiteLoader to Forge
- Internal refactoring for future maintainability
- Rendering rework, more robust with shaders but measurably slower
- Different config system with new default values

## Dependencies

- [FalsePatternLib 1.4.0+](https://github.com/FalsePattern/FalsePatternLib)
- [WorldEdit 6.3.0+](https://github.com/FalsePattern/WorldEdit)
